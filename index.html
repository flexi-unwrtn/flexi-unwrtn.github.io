<p>This project is a development of Open Source software for deployment on generic set top box hardware. Design goal is to automate the tasks of recording and playback of media.The objective of the device, designated as <code>flexi TV-R</code>, is to receive and execute programmable functions remotely and simply sync the media to a streaming repository.</p>

<p>July 10th, 2016, FFmpeg announced that they're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release. ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax. Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.</p>

<p>FFserver program has been forked to <code>flexi-unwrtn</code> repository and is used and maintained as a cloud based media streaming server that compliments our set top box platform functionality.The separation of tasks, record and store media on STB device, and streaming media playback cloud ffserver, enables a significant advance in PVR functionality.</p>
